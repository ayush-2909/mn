Step 1: Prepare the routers and configure the router hostname and interface addresses.
a. Cable the network as shown in the topology diagram. Erase the startup configuration and reload each
router to clear the previous configurations. Using the addressing scheme in the diagram, create the
loopback interfaces and apply IP addresses to them as well as the serial interfaces on R1, ISP1, and
ISP2.
You can copy and paste the following configurations into your routers to begin.
Note: Depending on the router model, interfaces might be numbered differently than those listed. You
might need to alter them accordingly.
Router R1
hostname R1
interface Loopback 0
description R1 LAN

no shutdown
Router ISP2 (R3)
hostname ISP2
interface Loopback0
description Simulated Internet Web Server
ip address 209.165.200.254 255.255.255.255

interface Serial0/0/0
description ISP2 --> R1
ip address 209.165.202.129 255.255.255.252

bandwidth 128
no shutdown
interface Serial0/0/1
description ISP2 --> ISP1
ip address 209.165.200.226 255.255.255.252
bandwidth 128
no shutdown
b. Verify the configuration by using the show interfaces description command. The output from router R1
is shown here as an example.
R1# show interfaces description
Interface Status Protocol Description
Fa0/0 admin down down
Fa0/1 admin down down
Se0/0/0 up up R1 --> ISP1
Se0/0/1 up up R1 --> ISP2
Lo0 up up R1 LAN
All three interfaces should be active. Troubleshoot if necessary.
c. The current routing policy in the topology is as follows:
• Router R1 establishes connectivity to the Internet through ISP1 using a default static route.
• ISP1 and ISP2 have dynamic routing enabled between them, advertising their respective public
address pools.
• ISP1 and ISP2 both have static routes back to the ISP LAN.



Note: For the purpose of this lab, the ISPs have a static route to an RFC 1918 private network address
on the branch router R1. In an actual branch implementation, Network Address Translation (NAT) would
be configured for all traffic exiting the branch LAN. Therefore, the static routes on the ISP routers would
be pointing to the provided public pool of the branch office. This is covered in Lab 7-1, “Configure Routing
Facilities to the Branch Office.”
Implement the routing policies on the respective routers. You can copy and paste the following
configurations.
Router R1
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.201.1
Router ISP1 (R2)
router eigrp 1
network 209.165.200.224 0.0.0.3
network 209.165.201.0 0.0.0.31
no auto-summary
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 209.165.201.2
Router ISP2 (R3)
router eigrp 1
network 209.165.200.224 0.0.0.3
network 209.165.202.128 0.0.0.31
no auto-summary
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 209.165.202.130
EIGRP neighbor relationship messages on ISP1 and ISP2 should be generated. Troubleshoot if
necessary.
%DUAL-5-NBRCHANGE: IP-EIGRP(0) 1: Neighbor 209.165.200.225 (Serial0/0/1) is
up: new adjacency
Step 2: Verify server reachability.
The Cisco IOS IP SLA feature enables an administrator to monitor network performance between Cisco
devices (switches or routers) or from a Cisco device to a remote IP device. IP SLA probes continuously check
the reachability of a specific destination, such as a provider edge router interface, the DNS server of the ISP,
or any other specific destination, and can conditionally announce a default route only if the connectivity is
verified.
a. Before implementing the Cisco IOS SLA feature, you must verify reachability to the Internet servers. From
router R1, ping the web server, ISP1 DNS server, and ISP2 DNS server to verify connectivity. You can
copy the following Tcl script and paste it intoR1.
foreach address {
209.165.200.254
209.165.201.30
209.165.202.158
} {
ping $address source 192.168.1.1
}
R1(tcl)# foreach address {
+>(tcl)# 209.165.200.254




+>(tcl)# 209.165.201.30
+>(tcl)# 209.165.202.158
+>(tcl)# } {
+>(tcl)# ping $address source 192.168.1.1
+>(tcl)#}
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 209.165.200.254, timeout is 2 seconds:

Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 209.165.201.30, timeout is 2 seconds:

Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 12/14/16 ms
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 209.165.202.158, timeout is 2 seconds:
Packet sent with a source address of 192.168.1.1
!!!!!
Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 20/21/24 ms
b. Trace the path taken to the web server, ISP1 DNS server, and ISP2 DNS server. You can copy the
following Tcl script and paste it into R1.
foreach address {
209.165.200.254
209.165.201.30
209.165.202.158
} {
trace $address source 192.168.1.1
}
R1(tcl)# foreach address {
+>(tcl)# 209.165.200.254

Step 3: Configure IP SLA probes.
When the reachability tests are successful, you can configure the Cisco IOS IP SLAs probes. Different types
of probes can be created, including FTP, HTTP, and jitter probes. In this scenario, you will configure ICMP
echo probes.
a. Create an ICMP echo probe on R1 to the primary DNS server on ISP1 using the ip sla command.
Note: With Cisco IOS Release 12.4(4)T, 12.2(33)SB, and 12.2(33)SXI, the ip sla command has replaced
the previous ip sla monitor command. In addition, the icmp-echo command has replaced the type echo
protocol ipIcmpEcho command.
R1(config)# ip sla 11
R1(config-ip-sla)# icmp-echo 209.165.201.30
R1(config-ip-sla-echo)# frequency 10
R1(config-ip-sla-echo)# exit
R1(config)# ip sla schedule 11 life forever start-time now
The operation number of 11 is only locally significant to the router. The frequency 10 command
schedules the connectivity test to repeat every 10 seconds. The probe is scheduled to start now and to
run forever.
b. Verify the IP SLAs configuration of operation 11 using the show ip sla configuration 11 command.
Note: With Cisco IOS Release 12.4(4)T, 12.2(33)SB, and 12.2(33)SXI, the show ip sla configuration
command has replaced the show ip sla monitor configuration command.
R1# show ip sla configuration 11

The output lists the details of the configuration of operation 11. The operation is an ICMP echo to
209.165.201.30, with a frequency of 10 seconds, and it has already started (the start time has already
passed).
c. Issue the show ip sla statistics command to display the number of successes, failures, and results of
the latest operations.
Note: With Cisco IOS Release 12.4(4)T, 12.2(33)SB, and 12.2(33)SXI, the show ip sla statistics
command has replaced the show ip sla monitor statistics command.
R1# show ip sla statistics
IPSLAs Latest Operation Statistics
IPSLA operation id: 11
Latest operation start time: *21:22:29.707 UTC Fri Apr 2 2010
Latest operation return code: OK
Number of successes: 5
Number of failures: 0
Operation time to live: Forever
You can see that operation 11 has already succeeded five times, has had no failures, and the last
operation returned an OK result.
d. Although not actually required because IP SLA session 11 alone could provide the desired fault tolerance,
create a second probe, 22, to test connectivity to the second DNS server located on router ISP2. You can
copy and paste the following commands on R1.
ip sla 22
icmp-echo 209.165.202.158
frequency 10
exit
ip sla schedule 22 life forever start-time now
e. Verify the new probe using the show ip sla configuration and show ip sla statistics commands.
R1# show ip sla configuration 22

Latest operation return code: OK
Number of successes: 4
Number of failures: 0
Operation time to live: Forever
The output lists the details of the configuration of operation 22. The operation is an ICMP echo to
209.165.202.158, with a frequency of 10 seconds, and it has already started (the start time has already
passed). The statistics also prove that operation 22 is active.
Step 4: Configure tracking options.
Although PBR could be used, you will configure a floating static route that appears or disappears depending
on the success or failure of the IP SLA.
a. Remove the current default route on R1, and replace it with a floating static route having an administrative
distance of 5.
R1(config)# no ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.201.1
R1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.201.1 5
R1(config)# exit
b. Verify the routing table.
R1# show ip route

C 209.165.202.128 is directly connected, Serial0/0/1
C 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
S* 0.0.0.0/0 [5/0] via 209.165.201.1
Notice that the default static route is now using the route with the administrative distance of 5. The first
tracking object is tied to IP SLA object 11.




c. Use the track 1 ip sla 11 reachability command to enter the config-track subconfiguration mode.
Note: With Cisco IOS Release 12.4(20)T, 12.2(33)SXI1, and 12.2(33)SRE and Cisco IOS XE Release
2.4, the track ip sla command has replaced the track rtr command.
R1(config)# track 1 ip sla 11 reachability
R1(config-track)#
d. Specify the level of sensitivity to changes of tracked objects to 10 seconds of down delay and 1 second of
up delay using the delay down 10 up 1 command. The delay helps to alleviate the effect of flapping
objects—objects that are going down and up rapidly. In this situation, if the DNS server fails momentarily
and comes back up within 10 seconds, there is no impact.
R1(config-track)# delay down 10 up 1
R1(config-track)# exit
R1(config)#
e. Configure the floating static route that will be implemented when tracking object 1 is active. To view
routing table changes as they happen, first enable the debug ip routing command. Next, use the ip
route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.201.1 2 track 1 command to create a floating static default route via
209.165.201.1 (ISP1). Notice that this command references the tracking object number 1, which in turn
references IP SLA operation number 11.
R1# debug ip routing

*Apr 2 21:27:07.851: RT: NET-RED 0.0.0.0/0
Notice that the default route with an administrative distance of 5 has been immediately flushed because
of a route with a better admin distance. It then adds the new default route with the admin distance of 2.
f. Repeat the steps for operation 22, track number 2, and assign the static route an admin distance higher
than track 1 and lower than 5. On R1, copy the following configuration, which sets an admin distance of 3.
track 2 ip sla 22 reachability
delay down 10 up 1
exit
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 209.165.202.129 3 track 2
g. Verify the routing table again.

Gateway of last resort is 209.165.201.1 to network 0.0.0.0
209.165.201.0/30 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C 209.165.201.0 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
209.165.202.0/30 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C 209.165.202.128 is directly connected, Serial0/0/1
C 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
S* 0.0.0.0/0 [2/0] via 209.165.201.1
Although a new default route was entered, its administrative distance is not better than 2. Therefore, it
does not replace the previously entered default route.
Step 5: Verify IP SLA operation.
In this step you observe and verify the dynamic operations and routing changes when tracked objects fail.
The following summarizes the process:
• Disable the DNS loopback interface on ISP1 (R2).
• Observe the output of the debug command on R1.
• Verify the static route entries in the routing table and the IP SLA statistics of R1.
• Re-enable the loopback interface on ISP1 (R2) and again observe the operation of the IP SLA
tracking feature.
ISP1(config)# interface loopback 1
ISP1(config-if)# shutdown
ISP1(config-if)#
*Apr 2 15:53:14.307: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface Loopback1, changed state to
administratively down
*Apr 2 15:53:15.307: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface
Loopback1, changed state to down
a. Shortly after the loopback interface is administratively down, observe the debug output being generated
on R1.
R1#
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: %TRACKING-5-STATE: 1 ip sla 11 reachability Up->Down
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: del 0.0.0.0 via 209.165.201.1, static metric [2/0]
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: delete network route to 0.0.0.0
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: NET-RED 0.0.0.0/0
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: NET-RED 0.0.0.0/0
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: add 0.0.0.0/0 via 209.165.202.129, static metric
[3/0]
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: NET-RED 0.0.0.0/0
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: default path is now 0.0.0.0 via 209.165.202.129
*Apr 2 21:32:33.323: RT: new default network 0.0.0.0
*Apr 2 21:32:33.327: RT: NET-RED 0.0.0.0/0
*Apr 2 21:32:46.171: RT: NET-RED 0.0.0.0/0
The tracking state of track 1 changes from up to down. This is the object that tracked reachability for IP
SLA object 11, with an ICMP echo to the ISP1 DNS server at 209.165.201.30.
R1 then proceeds to delete the default route with the administrative distance of 2 and installs the next
highest default route to ISP2 with the administrative distance of 3.



b. Verify the routing table.
R1# show ip route
Codes: C - connected, S - static, R - RIP, M - mobile, B - BGP
D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter area

ia - IS-IS inter area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static
route
o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route
Gateway of last resort is 209.165.202.129 to network 0.0.0.0
209.165.201.0/30 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C 209.165.201.0 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0
209.165.202.0/30 is subnetted, 1 subnets
C 209.165.202.128 is directly connected, Serial0/0/1
C 192.168.1.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
S* 0.0.0.0/0 [3/0] via 209.165.202.129
The new static route has an administrative distance of 3 and is being forwarded to ISP2 as it should.
c. Verify the IP SLA statistics.
R1# show ip sla statistics

d. Initiate a trace to the web server from the internal LAN IP address.

This confirms that traffic is leaving router R1 and being forwarded to the ISP2 router.



e. To examine the routing behavior when connectivity to the ISP1 DNS is restored, re-enable the DNS
address on ISP1 (R2) by issuing the no shutdown command on the loopback 1 interface on ISP2.
ISP1(config-if)# no shutdown
*Apr 2 15:56:24.655: %LINK-3-UPDOWN: Interface Loopback1, changed state to
up
*Apr 2 15:56:25.655: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface
Loopback1, changed state to up
Notice the output of the debug ip routing command on R1.

Now the IP SLA 11 operation transitions back to an up state and reestablishes the default static route to
ISP1 with an administrative distance of 2.
f. Again examine the IP SLA statistics.
